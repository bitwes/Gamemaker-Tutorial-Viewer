Gamemaker-Tutorial-Viewer
=========================

This allows you to view a tutorial outisde the GameMaker IDE.  This was done as a workaround for a bug in GameMaker that prevents you from opening up the Tutorial after reopening a project.  It's also useful to view the tutorial outside of GameMaker, in case you want to put it on a different monitor or just not take up the realestate in the IDE.  

#Directions
Enter the path to a GameMaker project directory using the _Browse_ button or by typing it in.  If you type/paste in the path then you have to hit the _Go_ button.

Use the back and next buttons to navigate through the tutorial.

#What it does
Once it has a GameMaker diectory, it will open up the .project.gmx file and find where the tutorial is stored.  It then opens up all the HTML files in the Tutorial directory.
